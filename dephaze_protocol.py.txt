# DEPHAZE PROTOCOL - CORE COMPUTATIONAL MODULE
# Author: Angus Dewer | www.dephaze.com
#
# Implements the core logic of the Dephaze model, focusing on the
# goal-directed evolution of the Psi-vector from a fixed informational
# singularity (t0) toward a virtual, symmetric target (Theta).

    Performs one time step update of the reality Phase-Field (Psi) vector.

    Args:

        Z_field_properties (dict): A dictionary containing the Z-Field's properties,
                                   e.g., {'D': diffusion_coeff, 'M': resistance_coeff}.
