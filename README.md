## Overview
**Dephaze** describes a **goal-directed, non-local, and self-regulating field** from which observable reality (`Ψ`) unfolds. It replaces random, law-driven evolution with an **adaptive projection process**: a timeless equilibrium (`Ω₀`) continuously unfolds toward a self-generated target configuration (`Imago`) through the creative operator (`Φ³`).

The central dynamic is measured by the **coherence ratio**:

Ξ = φ³ / φ⁻³ → Ξ > 1 evolution Ξ ≈ 1 critical Ξ < 1 stasis

---

## Core Concepts
**φ³** – space generation, the creative unfolding from `Ω₀` (≈ 4.236)  
**φ⁻³** – pattern trace, the measurable fossil left by φ³  
We never measure φ³ directly; we only observe φ⁻³ – the measurement limit of physics.

Key symbols: Ω₀ (timeless ground state) | Ψ (projected reality) | Imago (goal target) | Λ (feedback operator) | Ξ (coherence ratio)

---

## Ontology of Reality Formation
Reality is a **continuous projection** from the symmetric source `Ω₀` to the emergent `Imago`.  
Time = sampling sequence | Space = projection topology.

---

## Core Equation
Simplified form: dΨ/dt = Diffusion + Interaction − Resistance + Projection  
Where `D∇²Ψ` (diffusion), `G|Ψ|²Ψ` (self-interaction), `−Mφ⁻³` (inertia), `Φ³{Ω₀→Imago}` (goal-projection)

Full adaptive form:

dΨ(φ³)/d(ln t_phase) = D∇²[Ψ(φ⁻³)] + G|Ψ(φ⁻³)|²Ψ(φ⁻³) − Mφ⁻³ + δ(t−t₀)Φ³{Ω₀→Imago} − i[Λ,Ψ] + div(F) + KΨs + Σ + M[χ,Ψ] + P[χ,Ψ] + D[Ψ,χ_instr]

Core terms: D,G,M (diffusion, nonlinearity, inertia) | −i[Λ,Ψ] (feedback) | KΨs (memory) | Σ (noise)  
Extended operators: M (mutation) | P (persistent memory) | D (disinformation)

---

## Self-Regulation — the Ξ Monitor
The system keeps Ξ ≈ 1 for balance:  
Ξ < 1 → boost φ³ (explore) Ξ > 1 → stabilize φ⁻³ Ξ ≈ 1 → critical adaptability.  
This is **self-organized criticality**, not fine-tuning.

## Supported by
**Occam’s Razor — fewer assumptions, broader power.**

## What Dephaze Explains
Cosmology — β log dark-energy correction, σ₈/Hubble resolved  
Quantum Mechanics — measurement = bistable relaxation; entanglement = shared Ω₀  
Astrodynamics — Fly-by / Pioneer anomalies = φ⁻³ lag  
Complexity / Biology — consciousness = Λ-feedback; Ξ ≈ 1 self-regulation

---

## The Five Axioms
DEPHAZE_CORE_AXIOMS {  
AXIOM₀ Timeless Duality → Reality = Ω₀ ⊗ Ψ  
AXIOM₁ Projection Ontology → Ψ = Φ³[Ω₀ → Imago]  
AXIOM₂ Generation vs Pattern → Ξ = φ³ / φ⁻³  
AXIOM₃ Non-Local Unity → Field indivisible, entanglement = shared Ω₀ origin  
AXIOM₄ Self-Regulation → System adapts toward Ξ ≈ 1 (boost φ³ or stabilize φ⁻³)  
}

---

## Summary
**Dephaze** views the universe as a deterministic yet adaptive projection system. Randomness = feedback between generation and resistance. When Ξ ≈ 1, the system remains alive — coherent, evolving, self-aware through Λ-feedback. Reality is not the endpoint; **reality is the process.**
