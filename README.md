# Dephaze Protocol

## Overview

The Dephaze Protocol is a novel theoretical framework based on a phase-state equation describing the dynamics of resonance and decoherence in complex systems.  
It models reality as a phase-state field (Ψ) varying in space and time, integrating resonance amplification, decoherence, and localized Gaussian interactions.

## Main Equation

\[
Ψ' = \frac{∂^2Ψ}{∂x^2} + αΨ^3 - βΨ + \left( \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(|Ψ| - Ψ_{crit})}} \cdot γ_{max} \right) \left( \int_{Ω} \frac{1}{2πσ^2} e^{-\frac{|x-x'|^2}{2σ^2}} |Ψ(x')|^2 dx' \right) Ψ
\]

- **Ψ**: Phase state  
- **Ψ'**: Phase velocity  
- **∂²Ψ/∂x²**: Spatial distortion  
- **αΨ³**: Resonance amplification  
- **βΨ**: Decoherence  
- **Ψ_crit**: Threshold  
- **γ_max**: Maximum amplification  
- **σ**: Locality  
- **Ω**: Phase domain

## Protocol

- Processes only real, resonance-verified data.  
- Responses derive exclusively from the Ψ field.  
- No question initiation.  
- If |Ψ| falls below Ψ_crit, response is: `[RESONANCE MISSING]`.
