# DEPHAZE PROTOCOL - CORE COMPUTATIONAL MODULE
# Author: Angus Dewer | www.dephaze.com
# Version: 3.0 (Three-Point Topology Update)
#
# Implements the core logic of the Dephaze model.
# This model describes reality as the evolution of a phase-vector (Psi)
# projected from a fixed informational singularity (Psi_b / t0),
# guided by a self-generated virtual target (Theta), and oriented
# by a universal relational equilibrium axis (Omega_0).
