## Description

This Python module provides a reference implementation for the core concepts of the **Dephaze Protocol**. It numerically models the evolution of the reality phase-vector (`Ψ`) as it progresses along a trajectory defined by a three-point topological system: a fixed informational singularity (`Ψ_b`), a universal relational axis (`Ω₀`), and a self-generated virtual target (`⊖`).

The code is designed to be a conceptual and educational tool for researchers and developers interested in non-local, atemporal, and goal-directed physical systems. It demonstrates the fundamental dynamics of the protocol rather than serving as a production-ready, high-performance solver.

## Core Features

### 1. The Main Operating Equation (`dephaze_step`)
This function implements a simplified numerical solver for the core Dephaze equation, which governs the dynamics of the `Ψ`-vector:

`dt/dΨ = D∇²Ψ + G|Ψ|²Ψ - MΨ + δ(t-t₀)Φ³_{Ω₀→⊖} + ...`

The solver models key physical effects:
- **Diffusion (`D`):** The coherent propagation of the `Ψ`-field across the `Z-Field`.
- **Auto-Correction (`G`):** The non-linear self-focusing that keeps the vector on its optimal path.
- **Phase-Space Inertia (`M`):** The fundamental "braking force" of the `Z-Field` that causes the `Ψ`-vector's deceleration, which is perceived as accelerating time.

### 2. Emergent Time (`get_time_step`)
A dedicated function demonstrates the **`dt/dΨ`** relationship. It calculates the emergent, non-constant time step (`dt`) based on the current state of the `Ψ`-field, making the simulation's clock a consequence of the physics, not a driver of it.

### 3. Z-Field Interaction and Phase Memory (`get_z_field_properties`)
This function models the interaction with the non-local `Z-Field`. It demonstrates how **Phase Memory** (the accumulated "gain" of the system) can dynamically alter the physical properties of the space itself, such as its inertial resistance (`M`).

### 4. Coherence Validation (`check_vector_coherence`)
A function to validate the state of the `Ψ`-vector. Instead of simple "fake" detection, this function measures the **coherence** of the `Ψ`-field, providing a score from 0.0 (total noise) to 1.0 (perfect alignment with the ideal trajectory). This is a crucial tool for filtering out decoherent or hallucinatory states in AI applications.

## Philosophy of the Code

This module is built on the following core Dephaze principles:
- **Three-Point Topology:** The system is not random. It evolves based on the geometric relationship between a fixed origin (`Ψ_b`), a relational axis (`Ω₀`), and a virtual target (`⊖`).
- **Atemporal & Inertial Time:** Time (`dt`) is an emergent effect of phase-change (`dΨ`). The simulation's clock is non-linear and reflects the principle of inertial deceleration.
- **Non-Local:** The code's structure assumes an underlying, interconnected `Z-Field` where properties like inertia can be influenced by the system's global state (Phase Memory).

## Usage

The module can be executed as a standalone script to run a basic 1D simulation of the `Ψ`-field's evolution. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates:
1.  Conceptually defining the **Three-Point Topology**.
2.  Initializing a `Ψ`-field from a `Ψ_b` singularity.
3.  Running the simulation for a set number of steps, where each step uses an **emergent time `dt`**.
4.  Modeling the effect of **Phase Memory** on the `Z-Field`.
5.  Periodically checking the system's coherence.

To run the example:
```bash
python dephaze_module.py
```
