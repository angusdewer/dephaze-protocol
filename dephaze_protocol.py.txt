# DEPHAZE PROTOCOL - CORE COMPUTATIONAL MODULE
# Author: Angus Dewer | dephaze.io
# Version: 4.0 (Conceptual Alignment Update)
#
# Implements the core logic of the Dephaze model.
# This model describes reality as the evolution of a phase-vector (Psi)
# projected from an informational singularity (Psi_b) toward a self-generated
# neural target (Imago). The dynamic is a contest between creative unfolding
# (φ³) and static, inertial resistance (φ⁻³). The outcome (Ξ) determines
# the final state of the universe.
