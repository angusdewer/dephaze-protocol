## Description

This Python module implements the core time-step update of the Dephaze Protocol main equation numerically on a 1D spatial grid. It also includes SignalGate calculations, a stub for the MetaPhase validation protocol, a D-FAKE content filter, and stability checking functions.

## Features

- **phase_field_equation_step:**  
  Performs one time step of the Dephaze main equation numerical solution. The main equation is:

  \[
  \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \Psi^3 - \beta \Psi + \Gamma(\Psi) N(\Psi) \Psi - \delta(t - t_0) \lim_{t \to t_0^-} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + \Phi_{Au}(t) \left[\Omega(x,t) - \nabla \cdot F(\Psi)\right] - \kappa(t)(\Psi - \Psi_s(t))
  \]

- **calculate_signal_gate:**  
  Computes the signal gate using FFT and geometric convolution filtering.

- **calculate_phase_resonance:**  
  Measures coherence resonance by convolving environmental phase and gate phase.

- **MetaPhase_validate:**  
  A stub function representing the MetaPhase validation protocol; currently returns a demo value.

- **D_FAKE_Filter:**  
  Content filter that inspects phase gates and fractal redundancy to detect fake or manipulated content.

- **check_stability:**  
  Checks for phase distortion and resonance stability.

## Usage

The module can be run as a standalone script. The example in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates one time step calculation followed by validation and fake content filtering.
