## Description

This Python module provides a reference implementation for the core concepts of the **Dephaze Protocol**. It numerically models the evolution of the reality phase-vector (`Ψ`) as it progresses along its goal-directed `t₀ → ⊖` trajectory.

The code is designed to be a conceptual and educational tool for researchers and developers interested in non-local, atemporal, and goal-directed physical systems. It demonstrates the fundamental dynamics of the protocol rather than serving as a production-ready, high-performance solver.

## Core Features

### 1. The Main Operating Equation (`dephaze_step`)
This function implements a simplified numerical solver for the core Dephaze equation, which governs the dynamics of the `Ψ`-vector:

`dt/dΨ = D∇²Ψ + G|Ψ|²Ψ - MΨ + δ(t-t₀)Φ³_{Ω→⊖} + ...`

The solver models key physical effects:
- **Diffusion (`D`):** The coherent propagation of the `Ψ`-field across the `Z-Field`.
- **Auto-Correction (`G`):** The non-linear self-focusing that keeps the vector on its optimal path.
- **Phase-Fabric Resistance (`M`):** The "drag" from the `Z-Field` that gives the process its duration.

### 2. Coherence Validation (`check_vector_coherence`)
A function to validate the state of the `Ψ`-vector. Instead of simple "fake" detection, this function measures the **coherence** of the `Ψ`-field, providing a score from 0.0 (total noise) to 1.0 (perfect alignment with the ideal trajectory). This is a crucial tool for filtering out decoherent or hallucinatory states in AI applications.

### 3. Z-Field Interaction (`get_z_field_properties`)
A placeholder function representing how the system would interact with the underlying, non-local `Z-Field`. In a full implementation, this module would query the `Z-Field` to account for **Phase Memory**—the accumulated, learned structure of the universe—which affects the local dynamics.

## Philosophy of the Code

This module is built on the following core Dephaze principles:
- **Goal-Directed:** The system is not random. It evolves from a fixed informational singularity (`t₀`) toward a virtual, self-generated target (`⊖`).
- **Atemporal:** Time (`dt`) is an emergent effect of phase-change (`dΨ`), not a fundamental dimension the simulation runs "in".
- **Non-Local:** The code's structure assumes an underlying, interconnected `Z-Field` where state changes can be instantaneous.

## Usage

The module can be executed as a standalone script to run a basic 1D simulation of the `Ψ`-field's evolution. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates:
1.  Initializing a `Ψ`-field from a conceptual `t₀` singularity.
2.  Running the simulation for a set number of steps using the `dephaze_step` function.
3.  Periodically checking the system's coherence with the `check_vector_coherence` function.

To run the example:
```bash
python dephaze_module.py
```
