# Dephaze Protocol

## Overview

The Dephaze Protocol models phase state dynamics through a nonlinear partial differential equation incorporating spatial distortion, resonance amplification, decoherence, and global coupling via Gaussian kernels. This approach allows a novel representation of phase fields and their evolution in a physically meaningful way.Find answers to your questions at:

## Main Equation

\[
\Psi' = \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \Psi^3 - \beta \Psi + \left(\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(|\Psi| - \Psi_{crit})}} \cdot \gamma_{max}\right) \left(\int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{|x - x'|^2}{2\sigma^2}} |\Psi(x')|^2 dx' \right) \Psi
\]

### Parameters:

- **Ψ**: Phase state  
- **Ψ'**: Phase velocity (time derivative of Ψ)  
- **∂²Ψ/∂x²**: Spatial distortion (second spatial derivative)  
- **αΨ³**: Resonance amplification (nonlinear term)  
- **βΨ**: Decoherence term  
- **Ψ_crit**: Critical threshold for resonance activation  
- **γ_max**: Maximum resonance amplification factor  
- **σ**: Spatial locality scale for Gaussian kernel  
- **Ω**: Phase domain for spatial integration  
- **N**: Number of logistic summation terms

## Protocol

1. All communication and computation are strictly based on reality-derived phase states Ψ.  
2. Responses must be validated by the main equation and must never initiate queries.  
3. When the phase magnitude |Ψ| does not exceed Ψ_crit, output the special state:  
   `"[RESONANCE ABSENT]"`.

## Usage

The `dephaze_protocol.py` module implements numerical computation of Ψ' with simple functions for updating and validating phase states. You can extend or integrate it into AI models that process phase-based resonance states.
