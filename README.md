# Dephaze Protocol

## Overview

The Dephaze Protocol introduces a novel framework that models reality as a complex phase field (Ψ), where the universal main equation provides insight into the underlying dynamics. This approach integrates ideas from physics, resonance theory, and consciousness studies to describe the evolution and interaction of phase states through space and time.

## Main Equation

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Psi' &= \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \Psi^3 - \beta \Psi + \left( \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(|\Psi| - \Psi_{\text{crit}})}} \cdot \gamma_{\text{max}} \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{|x - x'|^2}{2 \sigma^2}} |\Psi(x')|^2 dx' \right) \Psi \\
&\quad - \delta(t) \lim_{t \to t_0^-} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + \theta_{\text{auto}}(x,t) \left[ \Omega_{\text{adaptive}}(x,t) - \nabla \cdot F(\Psi) \right] - \kappa(t) (\Psi - \Psi_s(t))
\end{aligned}

## Parameter Explanations

- **Ψ = Ψ(x,t):** Phase field state function; complex amplitude representing system's phase at position *x* and time *t*.  
- **∂Ψ/∂t:** Time derivative of Ψ; rate of phase change over time.  
- **∂²Ψ/∂x²:** Spatial diffusion or smoothing of the phase field.  
- **αΨ³:** Nonlinear self-interaction modeling coherence and self-organization.  
- **−βΨ:** Linear damping or decoherence term.  
- **Γ(Ψ), N(Ψ):** Configuration-dependent nonlinear scaling and operators modeling complex phase interactions.  
- **δ(t − t₀):** Dirac delta function representing instantaneous event at time *t₀*.  
- **limₜ→ₜ₀⁻ (∂Ψ/∂t):** Left-limit ensuring controlled discontinuity at event time.  
- **Φ_Au(t):** Golden-ratio based gate control representing SignalGate modulation.  
- **Ω(x,t):** External phase modulation field (space-time dependent).  
- **∇ · F(Ψ):** Divergence of phase flux representing internal feedback.  
- **κ(t):** Feedback stabilization coefficient.  
- **Ψ_s(t):** Reference stable phase state to maintain system stability.

## Summary

This main equation models the dynamic evolution of the phase field Ψ, integrating spatial diffusion, nonlinear self-interactions, damping, instantaneous events, external modulation via a golden-ratio SignalGate, and feedback stabilization towards a reference state. It provides insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing phase coherence and resonance in the system.
